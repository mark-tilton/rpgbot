# ============
# "frequency" is the number of minutes it is expected to take to trigger a quest.
# Adding frequency to a quest means it is a start point for a quest chain.
# A quest completes only when it is able to move on to the next step OR
#   when there are no more next steps.
# The requirements for a step are the requirements to go to that step NOT requirements for completing it!
# Rewards are given when arriving at a step
# Setting a req to quantity 0 will require the player to not have that item. Requiring a quantity of any other
#   positive integer will require the player to have AT LEAST that many items.
# Different drop tables can be defined for the same item. eg. 80% chance to get 10-100g, 10% chance to get 200-300g
# Consumable reqs can only specify an item once.
