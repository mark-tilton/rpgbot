# ============
# "frequency" is the number of minutes it is expected to take to trigger a quest.
# Adding frequency to a quest means it is a start point for a quest chain.
# Setting a req to quantity 0 will require the player to not have that item. Requiring a quantity of any other
#   positive integer will require the player to have AT LEAST that many items.
# Different drop tables can be defined for the same item. eg. 80% chance to get 10-100g, 10% chance to get 200-300g
# Setting "merge=Yes" on a step will allow all instances of that step to be merged when displaying the output
# Setting "hold_open=Yes" will force the quest to be held open even if the player doensn't meet the requirements for any next step.
